\noindent\textbf{Objectives:} 

\vspace{1em}
At the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item build and refine statistical models using the Bayesian paradigm
\item utilize Monte Carlo methods for statistical inference
\end{itemize}

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Prerequisites:}
PSTAT 120 A-B (probability and math-stat) and 126 (regression). Familiarity with R is required.

\noindent\textbf{Grading Policy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Homework (35\%).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There will be approximately 4 homeworks, due roughly every week on Sundays at midnight.
    \item Each homework assignment will be given as a template that you should work from.
    \item All code must be written to be reproducible in Rmarkdown
    \item  All derivations can be done in any format of your choosing (latex, written by hand) but must be legible and \emph{must be incorporated into your final pdf}.
    \item  Ask a TA \emph{early} if you have problems regarding submissions. 
    \item Homework not submitted online before the deadline will be considered late (10 point deduction). 24 hours after the deadline homework will not be accepted and no credit will be awarded. Do not wait until the night before it is due to start working!
  \end{itemize}

\item Midterm exam (20\%). \textbf{In person, May 9th 2023} . 

\item Quizzes (15\%)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Approximately 5 in quizzes (online), lowest dropped
    \item There is no make-up for missed quizzes.
    \item Section attendance is an important part of the course.
  \end{itemize}
\item Final exam (30\%). \textbf{In person, June 13th 2023}
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\noindent\textbf{Course Policies:}  

\begin{itemize}
\item Learning Cooperatively
\begin{itemize}
\item We encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. 
\item You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.
\end{itemize}
\item Academic Honesty
\begin{itemize} 
\item Cooperation has a limit. 
\item You should not share your code or answers directly with other students. 
\item Doing so doesn’t help them; it just sets them up for trouble on exams. 
\item Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the solutions.
\item Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. 
\item Penalties for cheating are severe — they range from a zero grade for the assignment up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.
\item Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! We are here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won’t need to copy any answers.
\end{itemize}
\item Copyright of Course Materials
\begin{itemize}
\item Most of the material for this course was prepared by Professor Alex Franks.
\item The lectures and course materials, including PowerPoint presentations, tests, outlines, and similar materials, are protected by U.S. copyright law and by University policy. 
\item I am the exclusive owner of the copyright in those materials I create. You may take notes and make copies of course materials for your own use. 
\item You may also share those materials with another student who is enrolled in or auditing this course.
\item You may not reproduce, distribute or display (post/upload) lecture notes or recordings or course materials in any other way — whether or not a fee is charged — without my express prior written consent. You also may not allow others to do so.
\item If you do so, you may be subject to student conduct proceedings under the UC Santa Barbara Student Code of Conduct.
\item Similarly, you own the copyright in your original papers and exam essays. If I am interested in posting your answers or papers on the course web site, I will ask for your written permission.
